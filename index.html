                    <h3>Rock of Pages: The Literary Tradition of 1980s Heavy Metal</h3>

                    <p>Rock of Pages offers a literary reading of 1980s heavy metal, using forty years of hindsight and
                        analytical methods
                        usually tied to literature. Drawing on his background as both professor and musician, Jesse
                        Kavadlo places the genre
                        within its cultural contexts, including the Cold War, MTV, and the PMRC hearings. Using the
                        PMRC’s own categories, the
                        book examines metal’s treatment of violence and justice, addiction and madness, sex and
                        relationships, and the occult
                        along with questions of morality. It argues that 1980s heavy metal showed more artistry than
                        many assumed and that
                        literature shares the same spirit of rebellion.</p>

                    <h3>Don DeLillo in Context</h3>

                    <p>Don DeLillo is one of the most important novelists of the late twentieth and early twenty-first
                        century. Yet despite
                        DeLillo's prolific output and scholarly recognition, much of the attention has gone to his works
                        individually, rather
                        than collectively or thematically. This volume provides separate entries into the wide variety
                        and categories of
                        contexts that surround and help illuminate DeLillo's writings. Don DeLillo in Context examines
                        how geography, biography,
                        history, media studies, culture, philosophy, and the writing process provide critical frameworks
                        and ways of reading and
                        understanding DeLillo's prodigious body of work.</p>

                    <h3>American Popular Culture in the Era of Terror</h3>
                    <p>American Popular Culture in the Era of Terror argues that twenty first century fiction, film, and
                        television have been
                        shaped by narratives driven by anxiety and a strange sense of wish fulfillment tied to
                        collapsing morality, family, law,
                        and storytelling. From aging superheroes and young adult dystopias to anti heroes and revived
                        vampires and zombies,
                        popular genres return repeatedly to the imagery of terror. Kavadlo’s study shows that many
                        novels and films responding
                        to September eleven explore far more than terrorism, while works that seem unrelated are still
                        deeply connected to it.
                        By examining post September eleven New York novels, television anti heroes, and the resurgence
                        of the undead across
                        media, the book outlines an Era of Terror that reflects the cultural impact of that event. It is
                        written for students
                        and scholars of popular culture and brings together multiple topics to reach a broad audience.

                    <h3>Michael Chabon’s America: Magical Words, Secret Worlds, and Sacred Spaces</h3>

                    <p>Michael Chabon is a major voice in contemporary American fiction, known for exploring late
                        twentieth and early twenty
                        first century life in works such as The Mysteries of Pittsburgh, Wonder Boys, Telegraph Avenue,
                        and the Pulitzer winning
                        The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay. Writing across novels, young adult fiction, essays,
                        and screenplays, he
                        follows the tradition of past stylists, yet his work has not received sustained critical
                        attention. Michael Chabon’s
                        America is the first scholarly collection devoted to his writing, showing how he uses genres
                        such as detective and comic
                        book fiction to frame the American experience. The essays examine his full body of work and
                        place it within cultural,
                        historical, and stylistic contexts, offering a comprehensive study of an author whose influence
                        merits closer analysis.</p>

                    <h3>Don DeLillo: Balance at the Edge of Belief</h3>

                    <p>Don DeLillo, recipient of major awards including the National Book Award, the William Dean
                        Howells Medal, and the
                        Jerusalem Prize, is a central novelist of the late twentieth and early twenty first centuries.
                        Though often read as a
                        prescient and postmodern voice of millennial culture, this book argues that his novels White
                        Noise, Libra, Mao II,
                        Underworld, and The Body Artist focus more directly on spiritual crisis. Filled with doubt,
                        estrangement, and longing,
                        these works still offer a moral counterpoint to the troubled worlds they depict. In the language
                        of contemporary
                        America, DeLillo uses these stories to explore the deeper questions of what it means to be
                        human.</p>
